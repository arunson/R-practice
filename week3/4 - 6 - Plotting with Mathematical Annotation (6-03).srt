1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,063
One nice feature of R is the ability to do
mathematical annotation within the

2
00:00:04,063 --> 00:00:07,048
plotting device.
So you can make plots that have

3
00:00:07,227 --> 00:00:11,093
mathematical symbols in them to annotate
them and provide context.

4
00:00:11,093 --> 00:00:16,169
So if you're familiar with the, the
language with the typesetting system known

5
00:00:16,169 --> 00:00:20,233
as LaTeX then your ability, then your
ability, then you have the ability to

6
00:00:20,233 --> 00:00:23,753
produce LaTeX like symbols on the plot
for, for, for doing mathematical

7
00:00:23,753 --> 00:00:27,044
annotation.
So this is very useful if you want to make

8
00:00:27,044 --> 00:00:31,035
fun of other people who use other
statistical packages cuz they, generally

9
00:00:31,035 --> 00:00:35,073
speaking, don't have the ability to add
LaTeX like symbols onto their plots.

10
00:00:35,073 --> 00:00:39,850
So if you're, if you want to make a plot
that's a lot nerdier than those plots then

11
00:00:40,017 --> 00:00:43,053
this is the way to do it.
So, the basic idea is that math symbols

12
00:00:43,053 --> 00:00:46,032
are expressions in r.
And so you have to use the expression

13
00:00:46,032 --> 00:00:49,008
function to encode them when you're using
them in a plot.

14
00:00:49,139 --> 00:00:51,974
So there's a list, there's a list, a
specific list of a, of allowed symbols

15
00:00:53,006 --> 00:00:55,987
for, for plotting mathematical annotation,
and they're documented in the help page

16
00:00:56,098 --> 00:00:58,821
for plot math.
And so the, if you're interested in doing

17
00:00:58,821 --> 00:01:03,184
this kind of annotation, you should really
look at the help page for plot math, and,

18
00:01:03,184 --> 00:01:06,559
and basically have it memorized, cuz it's
not that very long, and they're are not

19
00:01:06,559 --> 00:01:10,016
that many symbols.
So you can have it, in your head, and then

20
00:01:10,016 --> 00:01:12,073
do all ca, all the mathematical annotation
that you want.

21
00:01:12,297 --> 00:01:18,008
So plotting, plotting functions that take
arguments for any, for text, so like the

22
00:01:18,008 --> 00:01:22,881
title function the axis function the text
function, all these functions that take

23
00:01:23,069 --> 00:01:27,609
arguments that put labels on the plot,
will g, will generally allow expressions

24
00:01:27,609 --> 00:01:31,078
for the math symbol.
So, while you can pass regular text to be

25
00:01:31,078 --> 00:01:36,034
plotted on the, on the, on the graphics
device, you can also pass in an expression

26
00:01:36,034 --> 00:01:39,048
that will be translated into a
mathematical annotation.

27
00:01:39,229 --> 00:01:43,065
So here's a simple example.
Here, I'm just plotting I'm not plotting

28
00:01:43,065 --> 00:01:47,767
any data but I'm creating, I'm setting up
a plot window where the title of the plot

29
00:01:47,767 --> 00:01:50,089
is going to be the, the expression theta
equal zero.

30
00:01:51,106 --> 00:01:53,092
The y label is going to be expression,
gamma hat equal zero.

31
00:01:53,092 --> 00:01:59,068
And the x label is going to be the sum, so
like, so you can think ofs, the capital

32
00:01:59,068 --> 00:02:04,769
sigma representing the sum, where I goes
from one to n of xi times yi, the product

33
00:02:04,769 --> 00:02:08,025
xi times yi.
So these expressions will appear in the

34
00:02:08,025 --> 00:02:12,502
plot window and, and will be typeset in a
LaTeX like manner.

35
00:02:12,737 --> 00:02:19,063
You can also paste strings together so,
if, so for example, here, I can creating a

36
00:02:19,063 --> 00:02:24,336
histogram where the x label, as the
expression the mean, and then in

37
00:02:24,336 --> 00:02:29,627
parenthesis, x bar, is, and then the sum,
you know, x, xi over n from i, you, it

38
00:02:29,627 --> 00:02:33,143
goes from one to n.
So here, it's just defining what x bar is,

39
00:02:33,143 --> 00:02:36,653
which is the mean.
So you can paste strings together like

40
00:02:36,653 --> 00:02:41,405
this which include, you know, standard
text plus mathematical expressions.

41
00:02:41,405 --> 00:02:47,388
However, when you do this, all of it must
occur within the expression function.

42
00:02:47,658 --> 00:02:54,645
So one question is, so in the previous
example, I put hard coded, just constants,

43
00:02:54,645 --> 00:02:59,778
into the In to the labels that I want to
plot on, in the graphics device.

44
00:02:59,778 --> 00:03:04,383
What happens if the expression that you
want to plot is actually the result of a

45
00:03:04,383 --> 00:03:07,077
computation?
For example, suppose you want to say that

46
00:03:07,077 --> 00:03:10,843
the mean x bar is equal to and then the,
and then the mean of your data.

47
00:03:10,843 --> 00:03:15,488
Well you're not going to know what the
mean of your data is until you calculate

48
00:03:15,488 --> 00:03:19,862
it and so you might want to put the actual
calculation of the mean into the

49
00:03:20,029 --> 00:03:23,231
expression itself.
So here I'm generating some data to have a

50
00:03:23,231 --> 00:03:27,538
linear relationship, x and y, and I want
to plot x and y and on the, on the x axis,

51
00:03:27,538 --> 00:03:30,127
I want to have the x label be the mean of
x.

52
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:33,659
And on the y axis, I want to have the x,
the y label be the mean of y.

53
00:03:33,659 --> 00:03:37,995
So, of course, I don't know what those
numbers are until I calculate them, so I'm

54
00:03:37,995 --> 00:03:42,016
going to use the substitute function to
pa, rather than the expression function,

55
00:03:42,016 --> 00:03:46,221
because the substitute function will
substitute the actual value of the mean

56
00:03:46,384 --> 00:03:49,448
into my plot.
So here I'm saying that bar of x, which is

57
00:03:49,448 --> 00:03:52,205
x, which is so is going to be x bar, is
equal to k.

58
00:03:52,382 --> 00:03:56,573
And then and for k, I say I have, I passed
the list k is equal to the mean of x.

59
00:03:56,573 --> 00:04:03,452
And similarly for, for the y label I say
bar y or x bar equal to k, where in this

60
00:04:03,452 --> 00:04:07,134
case k is equal to the mean of y.
So now what substitute's going to do is

61
00:04:07,134 --> 00:04:11,178
going to, is going to take the, it's going
to take k, it's going to, it's going to

62
00:04:11,178 --> 00:04:15,375
substitute in the actual value of the mean
of x for the x label and then the mean of

63
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:18,257
y for the y label.
And so when I'm plo, when I call this plot

64
00:04:18,401 --> 00:04:22,846
and direct it toward the plot window where
na on, on my y label and my x label I am

65
00:04:22,846 --> 00:04:25,963
going to have the mean of each of those
dimensions.

66
00:04:26,168 --> 00:04:29,962
So ya, and this, the example down here,
I've got four plots and I'm trying to make

67
00:04:30,088 --> 00:04:34,027
two, in a two by two matrix.
And I've got an old four loop here that's

68
00:04:34,027 --> 00:04:38,016
making the plots, and what I'm going to do
is I'm going to create a histogram of some

69
00:04:38,016 --> 00:04:41,894
random genera, randomly generated data,
and in each and each histogram I want to

70
00:04:41,894 --> 00:04:46,005
put the title to be theta equals a number
one, two, three, four.

71
00:04:46,005 --> 00:04:51,001
So here I'm just substituting I'm saying,
I'm using the substitute, I'm saying theta

72
00:04:51,001 --> 00:04:55,045
equals num, and then num is going to be
equal to i, which is the index and the

73
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:58,056
four loop, which is going to be one, two,
three and four.

74
00:04:58,056 --> 00:05:03,035
So you can see the result here, is that I
get four plots, and the title for each one

75
00:05:03,035 --> 00:05:05,082
is theta is equal to one, two, three or
four.

76
00:05:05,082 --> 00:05:09,038
So, this is just some of the mathematical
annotation that you can do in R.

77
00:05:09,038 --> 00:05:13,290
You can get a lot fancier if you want to.
So, and in looking at the plot math help

78
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:17,047
page will allow you to see what kinds of
symbols you can put into your plots.

79
00:05:17,047 --> 00:05:21,059
So, just a very quick summary of the
important health pages that are useful to

80
00:05:21,059 --> 00:05:25,056
know when you're doing plotting in R.
The par function definitely should be

81
00:05:25,056 --> 00:05:29,063
looked at to look at all the different
options that you can specify when in the

82
00:05:29,063 --> 00:05:32,058
base plotting system.
The plot function, of course, is quite

83
00:05:32,058 --> 00:05:34,567
useful.
In the lattice system the xy plot function

84
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:39,214
it has pretty much all of the help
information that you're going to need if

85
00:05:39,214 --> 00:05:42,702
you use the lattice system.
The plot malt hea, math help page is

86
00:05:42,702 --> 00:05:46,707
useful for if you're doing mathematical
annotation and it is actually relevant to

87
00:05:46,707 --> 00:05:50,032
both the base plotting and the lattice
plotting system.

88
00:05:50,032 --> 00:05:54,071
So you can do mathematical annotation in
both systems using the same approach.

89
00:05:54,255 --> 00:05:58,552
And finally the axis function it's
actually quite useful if you, for the base

90
00:05:58,552 --> 00:06:06,058
plotting system if you want to annotate
axis in special ways.
