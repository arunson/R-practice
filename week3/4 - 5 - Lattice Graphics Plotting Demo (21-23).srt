1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,020
In this video I want to talk a little bit
about using the Lattice package in R.

2
00:00:04,036 --> 00:00:08,077
The way that you use the Lattice package
is a little bit different from, say, the

3
00:00:08,077 --> 00:00:12,039
base plotting functions that you use in
the base plotting system.

4
00:00:12,039 --> 00:00:16,065
And so I want to talk a little bit about
how you kind of write the code to make the

5
00:00:16,065 --> 00:00:20,064
plots that you want to use.
So, when using the Lattice package, it's

6
00:00:20,064 --> 00:00:24,074
often useful to have a separate editor
open to write code, because the, the

7
00:00:24,074 --> 00:00:28,333
function calls to the Lattice function
tend to be a little bit more involved, and

8
00:00:28,333 --> 00:00:33,182
it's hard to fit them all, or it's a
little inconvenient to fit them all into a

9
00:00:33,182 --> 00:00:36,141
single line.
In the base graphic system, a lot of times

10
00:00:36,141 --> 00:00:40,177
you're, you're calling single functions,
and you're calling a whole bunch of

11
00:00:40,177 --> 00:00:44,226
functions to make a single plot.
In the, the lattice package you are just

12
00:00:44,226 --> 00:00:47,665
usually calling one or maybe two
functions, and the, and the one function

13
00:00:47,665 --> 00:00:51,392
call will set up, although, an entire
plot, so often you'll have a really long

14
00:00:51,392 --> 00:00:54,420
function call.
And it's easier to have an editor window

15
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:58,264
open to write all that code.
Here I'm using R Studio, and in the upper

16
00:00:58,264 --> 00:01:01,746
left I've got the editor window.
And in the bottom left here I've got the

17
00:01:01,746 --> 00:01:05,478
console.
Other, other programs are fine for using a

18
00:01:05,478 --> 00:01:09,499
text editor if you want, if you want to
use the standard R console.

19
00:01:09,499 --> 00:01:13,432
But R Studio is actually quite helpful for
this kind of thing.

20
00:01:13,432 --> 00:01:18,277
So the first thing you can do is load the
library, the lattice package like this in

21
00:01:18,277 --> 00:01:21,519
the usual way.
Excuse me, and if you want to take a look

22
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:26,922
at some general information about lattice
say package lattice, package question mark

23
00:01:26,922 --> 00:01:30,435
lattice, that is.
And at least in our studio over here

24
00:01:30,435 --> 00:01:35,331
you'll see a nice little description of
the lattice package, with some general

25
00:01:35,331 --> 00:01:38,534
information.
Some references and some links to all of

26
00:01:38,534 --> 00:01:42,844
the functions in the lattice package that
you may want to look at.

27
00:01:42,844 --> 00:01:48,584
The most important function in the lattice
package really is the XY plot function so

28
00:01:48,584 --> 00:01:52,558
I'll click on that here.
And the XY plot function gives you a long

29
00:01:52,558 --> 00:01:57,627
list of arguments and options that can be
passed to the function and a description

30
00:01:57,627 --> 00:02:03,304
of all those arguments.
So I'm going to move on and start plotting

31
00:02:03,304 --> 00:02:07,173
some data.
So the first thing we're gonna do is we're

32
00:02:07,173 --> 00:02:10,499
gonna see what's in the lattice package
here.

33
00:02:10,499 --> 00:02:16,854
And you can see that there are number of
functions and data sets available here.

34
00:02:16,854 --> 00:02:22,246
And the one data set we're going to look
at is the environmental data set here.

35
00:02:22,246 --> 00:02:26,994
So I'm going to load that data set for us
to use here.

36
00:02:26,994 --> 00:02:35,211
So, I'm loading the environmental data
set.

37
00:02:35,211 --> 00:02:39,308
And, of course, you can always get the
help page for each data set.

38
00:02:39,308 --> 00:02:44,028
So I can take a look at that here.
And you can see it's environmental,

39
00:02:44,028 --> 00:02:46,848
conditions in New York City in 197-,
September.

40
00:02:46,848 --> 00:02:49,769
Sorry, excuse me.
May to September of 1973.

41
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:53,934
You have information about ozone,
radiation, temperature and, wind.

42
00:02:53,934 --> 00:02:57,711
So, and, and, of course, there's, other
variables for the dates.

43
00:02:57,711 --> 00:03:02,695
So, we've loaded this data set here.
So let's just take a look at the first

44
00:03:02,695 --> 00:03:07,649
couple of rows here.
You can see down at the console here the

45
00:03:07,649 --> 00:03:10,663
ozone radiation temperature and wind
variables.

46
00:03:10,663 --> 00:03:15,780
And so I'm going to simple, make a simple
scatter plot of ozone and radiation.

47
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:20,877
So the way you do this is with the XY plot
function, and it's backwards from the

48
00:03:20,877 --> 00:03:24,851
usual plotting function.
So instead of doing X and Y, you're going

49
00:03:24,851 --> 00:03:28,598
to do Y tilt to X.
So on the Y axis I want ozone, and on the

50
00:03:28,598 --> 00:03:32,899
X axis I want radiation.
So I'm going to do that, do it this way

51
00:03:32,899 --> 00:03:36,004
here.
So it's kind of like a response and a

52
00:03:36,004 --> 00:03:39,068
predictor.
And then you also have to give it a data

53
00:03:39,068 --> 00:03:45,008
argument, which tells the function xy plot
where to find the variables ozone and

54
00:03:45,008 --> 00:03:48,008
radiation.
Because ozone and radiation are not

55
00:03:48,008 --> 00:03:52,037
objects in my work space.
They are variables in this data frame.

56
00:03:52,037 --> 00:03:57,052
So what xy plot will do, is it'll look up
those, names inside this data frame.

57
00:03:58,084 --> 00:04:02,800
Close that, and you can see that the
function is called, and plot appears in

58
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:06,050
the right, here.
And, looks like a standard scatter plot,

59
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:10,075
nothing, may be slightly different from
the usual plotting function.

60
00:04:10,094 --> 00:04:16,011
I can see that, actually a lot of the,
spacing has been arranged for you, so that

61
00:04:16,011 --> 00:04:21,016
the plot goes more or less to the edges,
it doesn't waste any space on the edges.

62
00:04:21,034 --> 00:04:26,045
You have to set any spacing options, so I
could have done some thing like xy plot

63
00:04:26,045 --> 00:04:35,184
and then add a little title to it.
So maybe I'll say main equals ozone,

64
00:04:35,184 --> 00:04:40,052
versus radiation.
And if I run that, you'll see that the

65
00:04:40,052 --> 00:04:43,079
plot is made, but the title is added to
the top.

66
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:49,014
And notice that the, that the, the
plotting region was squished down just a

67
00:04:49,014 --> 00:04:53,037
tiny little bit, so that the title could
be, fit into there.

68
00:04:53,058 --> 00:04:59,000
But just, only enough room was made to
create the title so as to not waste any

69
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,076
space.
Okay.

70
00:04:59,076 --> 00:05:03,072
So, there's another variable here which is
temperature.

71
00:05:03,072 --> 00:05:14,095
So I could plot temperature here.
And this is what it looks like here.

72
00:05:14,095 --> 00:05:18,079
So nothing special.
But of course one of the things that,

73
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:24,013
that, that the lattice package function
excels at is allowing you to plot, kind of

74
00:05:24,013 --> 00:05:28,182
multivariate, or lattice, type plots, so,
which allow you to look at the

75
00:05:28,182 --> 00:05:32,575
relationships between variables, when you
condition on the levels of another

76
00:05:32,575 --> 00:05:35,770
variable.
So for example, on this plot up here, we

77
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:40,265
will look at ozone and radiation.
One of the questions you might want to

78
00:05:40,265 --> 00:05:44,913
know is whether or not the relationship
between ozone and radiation changes as the

79
00:05:44,913 --> 00:05:48,076
temperature changes.
So first thing you'll notice in this plot

80
00:05:48,076 --> 00:05:52,729
is that there's kind of a cone shape to
it, and as the radiation increases the,

81
00:05:52,729 --> 00:05:55,032
the variability in ozone seems to
increase.

82
00:05:55,032 --> 00:05:59,439
So one thing that maybe, one thing that
maybe going on here is that there's an

83
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:03,735
interaction with the third variable, maybe
temperature which modifies the

84
00:06:03,735 --> 00:06:07,021
relationship between ozone and radiation
in the background.

85
00:06:07,021 --> 00:06:11,057
And so we can plot the relationship
between ozone and radiation for different

86
00:06:11,057 --> 00:06:16,556
values of the temperature variable to see
if that rela-, relationship is changing

87
00:06:16,556 --> 00:06:20,006
with temperature.
So the first, that's, so temperature

88
00:06:20,006 --> 00:06:29,202
continuous variable, as you'll see here,
so you can't exactly condition on the

89
00:06:29,202 --> 00:06:35,015
levels of temperature, because there are
theoretically infinite number of levels of

90
00:06:35,015 --> 00:06:37,829
temperature.
So, what we're going to want to do is cut

91
00:06:37,829 --> 00:06:41,068
the temperature variable into a few
different, ranges.

92
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:46,052
And then we'll plot the ozone and
radiation relationship within those ranges

93
00:06:46,052 --> 00:06:50,028
of temperature.
So I'm going to create a, another variable

94
00:06:50,028 --> 00:06:56,045
here, called Temp, Cut, which is going to
be the, I'm going to use the equal count

95
00:06:56,045 --> 00:07:00,030
function on the original temperature
variable.

96
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:06,253
And I'm going to give, what I'm going to
do is I'm going to create four different

97
00:07:06,253 --> 00:07:12,050
ranges of the temperature, of the original
temperature variable, so that I can use

98
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:16,646
this in my plotting.
So when I call this, and I print out the

99
00:07:16,646 --> 00:07:22,549
new variable, you'll see that what it does
is create, it creates what is called a

100
00:07:22,549 --> 00:07:26,970
shingle variable, and the shingles here
are, are different intervals that are

101
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:30,067
slightly overlapping.
So you see the first interval goes from

102
00:07:30,067 --> 00:07:34,088
56.5 to 76.5 degrees Fahrenheit.
And there are 46 observations in that

103
00:07:34,088 --> 00:07:39,066
range and in the next shingle goes from
67.5 to 81.5, there's 51 observations in

104
00:07:39,066 --> 00:07:42,060
that range.
And you can see that in the first range

105
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:47,044
and the second range overlap just a little
bit and then in the third range which

106
00:07:47,044 --> 00:07:51,002
overlaps with the second it's 75.5 to 86.5
degrees Fahrenheit.

107
00:07:51,002 --> 00:07:54,087
Again there's 51 observations.
And then the last shingle also has 51

108
00:07:54,087 --> 00:07:58,028
observations.
So this function created four ranges of

109
00:07:58,028 --> 00:08:01,062
the temperature variable, all of which
overlap slightly.

110
00:08:01,062 --> 00:08:06,000
And, and have equal, roughly equal numbers
of observations in them.

111
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,479
So now what we're going to do up at the
top here, so I'm going to plot the ozone

112
00:08:11,479 --> 00:08:17,026
and radiation data, but I'm going to
condition on the ranges of this temp

113
00:08:17,026 --> 00:08:18,038
variable.
Okay.

114
00:08:18,038 --> 00:08:24,349
And so know what it-, you'll see is now
I've created a lattice plot here, where

115
00:08:24,349 --> 00:08:28,662
each of the four plot, there, of the four
plots here, plots ozone versus radiation,

116
00:08:28,662 --> 00:08:33,717
but for a different range of temperatures.
So on the bottom left over here, this is

117
00:08:33,717 --> 00:08:37,101
the rel-, this, these are, there is 46
observations here.

118
00:08:37,101 --> 00:08:41,379
I'm looking at ozone and temp-, and
radiation for the kind of range of

119
00:08:41,379 --> 00:08:45,190
temperature that's between 56.5 and 76.5
degrees Fahrenheit.

120
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:49,946
And you can see, actually that's there
almost no relationship between ozone and

121
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:55,587
radiation, in this temperature ring.
This is a fairly cool, temperature range.

122
00:08:55,587 --> 00:09:00,533
So one thing that's, that we know about
ozone is that, it's, the, the production

123
00:09:00,533 --> 00:09:03,968
of ozone is related to the temperature.
So, the warmer the temperature, the more

124
00:09:03,968 --> 00:09:06,080
ozone you're going to get in the
atmosphere.

125
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:10,056
So perhaps we should expect that in the
cooler range of temperature, we're not

126
00:09:10,056 --> 00:09:13,049
gonna see much of a relationship between
radiation and ozone.

127
00:09:13,063 --> 00:09:17,053
As to now, in the second range here, we
see, that, that there is a, not much of a

128
00:09:17,053 --> 00:09:21,023
relationship between ozone temperatures,
though there are a few outliers here.

129
00:09:21,038 --> 00:09:25,037
And then as you increase the temperature
in the third plot here of an, on the upper

130
00:09:25,037 --> 00:09:29,066
left, you see that there's a, there's an
increasing relationship with radiation.

131
00:09:29,066 --> 00:09:31,185
And then, in the fourth plot here, you
see.

132
00:09:31,185 --> 00:09:35,638
Even more of a relationship between ozone
and radiation for the last temperature

133
00:09:35,638 --> 00:09:39,331
range, which is between 80.5 and 97.5
degrees Fahrenheit.

134
00:09:39,331 --> 00:09:44,591
And so the, the, the x, y plot function is
useful for making these kind of

135
00:09:44,591 --> 00:09:48,486
conditioning plots.
Where we plot the relationship between two

136
00:09:48,486 --> 00:09:51,721
variables.
And by con-, and condition on the levels

137
00:09:51,721 --> 00:09:55,606
of a third variable.
In this case, the temperature variable

138
00:09:55,606 --> 00:09:58,331
which we've cut into four different
ranges.

139
00:09:58,331 --> 00:10:02,948
There are a few other things that we can
do to this plot just to make, re-arrange

140
00:10:02,948 --> 00:10:06,939
it a little bit, just in case you don't
like the default layout.

141
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:11,215
For example we can we can change the
order, arrangement of the plot so if the

142
00:10:11,215 --> 00:10:15,990
default arrangement goes from the bottom
left to the bottom right to the top left

143
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:19,623
to the top right.
If you don't like that, you can, you can

144
00:10:19,623 --> 00:10:24,869
change it, so that, for example, we can
have four on top each other.

145
00:10:24,869 --> 00:10:29,440
So we can say layout is one, four, and
then when we do this.

146
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:34,312
So you'll see there are four different
plots, all on top of each other and now

147
00:10:34,312 --> 00:10:38,169
you can see perhaps a little bit more
clearly, that the ranges of the

148
00:10:38,169 --> 00:10:42,138
temperature are overlapping slightly.
And, and exact roughly speaking kind of

149
00:10:42,138 --> 00:10:46,427
where, how they relate to each other.
We can also change the order in which the

150
00:10:46,427 --> 00:10:50,655
plots are drawn, so instead of say for
example from bottom to top, which is the

151
00:10:50,655 --> 00:10:55,516
default, we can draw the plots from top to
bottom by simply adding the as.table

152
00:10:55,516 --> 00:11:01,048
argument, saying as.table equals true and
that will give us the, the reverse order.

153
00:11:01,048 --> 00:11:06,028
So now you can see that the, the plot for
the bottom temperature range is on the

154
00:11:06,028 --> 00:11:10,012
plot, is on the top, and the temperature
increases as you go down.

155
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:14,091
You can do this also without the, if you
wanted the, if you liked the original

156
00:11:14,091 --> 00:11:20,007
layout with the four plots as in a square,
you can do that, and now you can see that

157
00:11:20,007 --> 00:11:23,073
the, the plot goes from the top left down
to the bottom right.

158
00:11:23,073 --> 00:11:29,044
Another thing that might be useful to do
for visualization purposes is to actually

159
00:11:29,044 --> 00:11:34,080
plot the relationship between solar
radiation and ozone within each of the

160
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:38,066
panels.
And the way we can do this is to write our

161
00:11:38,066 --> 00:11:43,006
own panel function here.
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to

162
00:11:43,006 --> 00:11:48,085
edit this call here, and I'm going to add
a, my own panel function here so and I'm

163
00:11:48,085 --> 00:11:53,005
just going to do.
So the typical panel function has x for

164
00:11:53,005 --> 00:11:57,046
the x coordinates, and y for the y
coordinates, so you can think of these as

165
00:11:57,046 --> 00:11:59,099
the x and the y coordinates for each
panel.

166
00:11:59,099 --> 00:12:03,040
So the same function is going to be
applied to each panel.

167
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:07,005
And so it has to work for the data in each
of the four panels.

168
00:12:07,005 --> 00:12:10,810
And then the dot, dot, dot argument is all
of the other graphics parameters that

169
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:15,474
would normally be passed to the default
panel function, which I'm not going to

170
00:12:15,474 --> 00:12:19,571
modify at all.
So now I've got my, I'm going to write my

171
00:12:19,571 --> 00:12:23,052
custom panel function.
And the first thing I'm going to do is

172
00:12:23,052 --> 00:12:27,073
call the default panel function.
And the reason why is I want to be able to

173
00:12:27,073 --> 00:12:32,006
set up a plotting region, I want to be
able to set the plot symbol, the colors,

174
00:12:32,006 --> 00:12:35,032
the labels, everything.
None of that is something I want to

175
00:12:35,032 --> 00:12:38,075
change, all I want to do is add a
regression line to the plot.

176
00:12:38,075 --> 00:12:42,057
So now I've got my plot set up.
I can fit a simple linear regression

177
00:12:42,057 --> 00:12:47,029
model, which is using the LM function of Y
tilde X and then I can add the line.

178
00:12:47,029 --> 00:12:50,053
To the plot with the panel.ad line
function.

179
00:12:50,053 --> 00:12:55,081
And just give it the fit, output from LM,
and that's it.

180
00:12:55,081 --> 00:13:01,891
So that's my custom, panel function here.
So now, I'm going to call, I'm going to

181
00:13:01,891 --> 00:13:06,823
run this whole block of code.
Excuse me, and when I do you, will see

182
00:13:06,823 --> 00:13:11,585
that in each of the panels a regression
line is overlaid on to the data which is

183
00:13:11,585 --> 00:13:15,139
the, kind of regression fit to the data
within that panel.

184
00:13:15,139 --> 00:13:20,552
And as you can see, the regression line is
relatively flat in the upper left panel.

185
00:13:20,552 --> 00:13:26,074
And as you go to the upper right to the
lower left and then to the lower right the

186
00:13:26,074 --> 00:13:29,393
slope of the line is increasing as you go
along.

187
00:13:29,393 --> 00:13:35,045
You can use some of the standard plotting,
options if you want to modify the, the,

188
00:13:35,045 --> 00:13:40,025
the plotting, in the, within each panel.
For example, if you wanted to make the

189
00:13:40,025 --> 00:13:43,245
line a little bit thicker, you can say LWD
is equal to two.

190
00:13:43,248 --> 00:13:48,266
And maybe, let's say you wanted to change
the plotting symbol to be a solid circle,

191
00:13:48,266 --> 00:13:53,046
so I can just in the call to x, y plot, to
see if PC is equal to twenty.

192
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:57,010
That will give me a solid circle.
So now I'm going to run this code.

193
00:13:57,027 --> 00:14:01,055
You'll see that the plotting symbol has
changed, and the regression line's a

194
00:14:01,055 --> 00:14:04,099
little bit thicker.
And so you can modify this to, until it

195
00:14:04,099 --> 00:14:09,002
looks the way you want it to look.
You can see why you might want to use the

196
00:14:09,002 --> 00:14:11,088
text editor now when you're using the
lattice package.

197
00:14:11,088 --> 00:14:16,044
Because the function calls to things like
xy plot, to, can get very quickly

198
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:20,280
complicated, just because you're
customizing things, and you're adding your

199
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:24,007
own panel function and whatever.
All of it under the same function call.

200
00:14:24,007 --> 00:14:26,891
So I'm just going to add, maybe just, one
modification here.

201
00:14:26,891 --> 00:14:31,301
Instead of doing a linear model, I'm going
to use a low s, which is just a smoother.

202
00:14:31,301 --> 00:14:36,208
So I can do, panel, excuse me.
Panel low e-, panel low s here.

203
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:41,810
On xy, and that will get me a smooth
rendition of the line.

204
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:47,017
So now you can see that actually, the, in
the lower right, which is the high

205
00:14:47,017 --> 00:14:51,920
temperature range, the relationship
appears to be a little bit non linear

206
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:57,814
there, which an increase, with, with
radiation, but then a decrease at the very

207
00:14:57,814 --> 00:15:01,089
end.
I can, also just change the labels on the

208
00:15:01,089 --> 00:15:06,658
X axis, and maybe on the X lab I want to
say, solar radiation, and then on the Y

209
00:15:06,658 --> 00:15:12,543
label.
I just want to say ozone, maybe in part

210
00:15:12,543 --> 00:15:17,069
per billion.
So I can run this code now.

211
00:15:18,027 --> 00:15:31,512
Oh I, let me just add a title.
And I can put this on the next line here.

212
00:15:31,512 --> 00:15:38,004
So now I can run this code again.
And you can see that the margins and

213
00:15:38,004 --> 00:15:42,061
everything gets adjusted.
So you're able to fit the, the labels onto

214
00:15:42,061 --> 00:15:45,068
the plot.
And so you don't have to worry about

215
00:15:45,068 --> 00:15:49,030
things like spacing.
Finally, I just want to show one more

216
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:52,037
example of how you can look at
interactions in R.

217
00:15:52,037 --> 00:15:57,000
So I, so there's a, there's one more
variable in this data set, which is the

218
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,069
wind variable.
And so we can look at how ozone and solar

219
00:16:00,069 --> 00:16:03,076
radiation vary with both temperature and
wind.

220
00:16:03,076 --> 00:16:09,260
So I'm going to cut the wind variable
into, again, four parts, with the equal

221
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:13,775
count function.
You can see that we can just take a look

222
00:16:13,775 --> 00:16:20,618
at the, this new variable here, and you
can see that there are four intervals and

223
00:16:20,618 --> 00:16:26,064
they do overlap, but and they're roughly
equal count within each interval.

224
00:16:26,064 --> 00:16:33,268
So now I can, I'm going to take my
original code here, paste it in, but now

225
00:16:33,268 --> 00:16:40,333
I'm going to, I'm gong to plot the
relationship by range of temperature and

226
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:46,567
by range of wind.
And so we can run this code now and see

227
00:16:46,567 --> 00:16:50,018
what happens.
And so now you can see that actually

228
00:16:50,035 --> 00:16:54,070
there's sixteen plots now instead of four,
which makes sense, because there's four

229
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:58,084
different levels of temperature and
there's four different levels of wind, so

230
00:16:58,084 --> 00:17:02,092
the combination of the, of the two
together is sixteen possible combinations.

231
00:17:02,092 --> 00:17:08,052
So you can see on the on the upper left
here is for when wind and temperature are

232
00:17:08,052 --> 00:17:13,061
on the low range, and all the way down
here at the bottom right is when wind and

233
00:17:13,061 --> 00:17:18,063
temperature are in their high range, and
everything else in between is for some

234
00:17:18,063 --> 00:17:21,081
combination of wind and temperature in
between.

235
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:26,879
So you can see that these, you can see how
the relationship between solar radiation

236
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:30,934
and ozone changes for different
combinations of low wind/high temperature,

237
00:17:30,934 --> 00:17:34,914
low temperature/high wind etc.
Or maybe medium wind and medium

238
00:17:34,914 --> 00:17:39,550
temperature, and you can see that the
relationship is perhaps most interesting

239
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:44,535
with, for the kind of high temperature,
and then maybe low to moderate wind, and

240
00:17:44,535 --> 00:17:49,506
then in this upper right corner over here
you can see the positioning on the

241
00:17:49,506 --> 00:17:52,817
relationship there between the radiation
and the ozone.

242
00:17:52,817 --> 00:17:57,380
And so you can see that for each of the
two conditioning variables there's a

243
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:03,483
little highlight slider that shows kind of
where you are on either the wind or the

244
00:18:03,483 --> 00:18:08,589
temperature range, whether you're low, in
the middle, or you're in the high end and,

245
00:18:08,589 --> 00:18:13,923
so that helps you kind of see where you
are in the range of the conditioning

246
00:18:13,923 --> 00:18:17,000
variable.
So, these things can all be kind of

247
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:22,057
customized if you want in terms of the
colors and the labeling, but this, but by

248
00:18:22,057 --> 00:18:27,400
default you can see that the, that R, the
X Y plot function will use the name of the

249
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:30,060
variable as the label within the strip up
here.

250
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:34,050
So that's a quick demo of the X Y plot
function in lattice.

251
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:40,005
There are a few other handy functions in
the lattice package that of course your,

252
00:18:40,005 --> 00:18:44,087
you can use and may find handy.
So one of them is the scatter plot matrix

253
00:18:44,087 --> 00:18:50,208
function or the SPLOM function.
So you can use the, the SPLOM function to

254
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:55,244
look at pairwise relationships, so I'm
going to use SPLOM, and then you give it a

255
00:18:55,244 --> 00:18:58,076
tilde and then give it, you can give it
the entire data set.

256
00:18:58,076 --> 00:19:03,034
If you want to look at all possible
combinations in this data set and when you

257
00:19:03,034 --> 00:19:07,099
run that you'll see it makes those scatter
plots of all the different variables

258
00:19:07,099 --> 00:19:12,005
against each other in, in to each one
plotted in two different forms.

259
00:19:12,022 --> 00:19:15,071
You can also look at histograms with the
histogram function.

260
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:19,688
So you can look at histogram of, let's say
a single variable, say temperature, and

261
00:19:19,688 --> 00:19:24,355
give a data equals environmental here.
And with that right, you will see a

262
00:19:24,355 --> 00:19:26,704
histogram of the temperature variable
here.

263
00:19:26,704 --> 00:19:30,716
So that's pretty standard.
There's nothing particularly special about

264
00:19:30,716 --> 00:19:33,257
that.
But again, you could look at something

265
00:19:33,257 --> 00:19:37,320
like temperature at the, histogram,
histogram of temperature as the wind

266
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:42,006
varies, so I can say, I can use my
wind.cut variable and then plot a

267
00:19:42,006 --> 00:19:46,483
histogram of temperature for each range of
wind, and you can see that the

268
00:19:46,483 --> 00:19:50,989
distribution of temperature doesn't change
too dramatically as the wind changes.

269
00:19:50,989 --> 00:19:56,437
But another thing we could do is say look
at the histogram of O, the distribution of

270
00:19:56,437 --> 00:20:01,405
ozone as the wind changes, and see if that
is of anything, is anything interesting.

271
00:20:01,405 --> 00:20:06,286
And you can see that as the, as the wind
increases, the ozone is a little bit more

272
00:20:06,286 --> 00:20:10,053
concentrated in the lower range.
Whereas, when there's very little wind,

273
00:20:10,053 --> 00:20:14,438
the distribution seems to be spread a
little bit, to, towards the higher range.

274
00:20:14,438 --> 00:20:18,191
So the distribution does appear to change
a little bit, with wind.

275
00:20:18,191 --> 00:20:22,054
So, so that's the histogram function,
which can be used in, in very much the

276
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:25,253
same way as the ozone func-, as the xy
plot function, excuse me.

277
00:20:25,253 --> 00:20:27,725
Where you can condition on different
variables.

278
00:20:27,725 --> 00:20:31,918
Of course, we could condition on both
temperature and wind, to see what the

279
00:20:31,918 --> 00:20:35,646
distribution looks like when you condition
on those two variables.

280
00:20:35,646 --> 00:20:39,868
And you can see that, as wind and
temperature changes, the distribution does

281
00:20:39,868 --> 00:20:43,714
become more spread out, or more
concentrated towards zero, depending on

282
00:20:43,714 --> 00:20:46,967
which way you're going.
So in the bottom right over here we see

283
00:20:46,967 --> 00:20:50,878
that when there is very low wind and very
high temperature, the distribution is

284
00:20:50,878 --> 00:20:54,770
most, kind of spread out towards the
higher range whereas when there is very

285
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:58,845
high temperature and very low wind, excuse
me, when there is very high wind and very

286
00:20:58,845 --> 00:21:02,707
low temperature in the upper left, most of
the values of ozone are concentrated

287
00:21:02,707 --> 00:21:06,000
around zero.
So that's the histogram and scatter plot

288
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,092
matrix function and as well as the X Y
plot function.

289
00:21:08,092 --> 00:21:13,362
So these are just a few of the functions
in the lattice package that can be used to

290
00:21:13,362 --> 00:21:18,921
plot data, and then more importantly to
plot conditional relationships of data in

291
00:21:18,921 --> 00:21:23,029
a way that's very compact and very useful
to visualize.
