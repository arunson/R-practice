1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,082
So here, I've started up bar and I'm just
gonna do a little bit of simple plotting

2
00:00:04,082 --> 00:00:09,036
to just kind of show what the, the basics
are of the of the, the plotting options.

3
00:00:09,036 --> 00:00:12,838
So, I'm going to stimulate a litte, a
little bit of data here so I can make a

4
00:00:12,838 --> 00:00:15,408
plot.
So, I have a hundred random variables here

5
00:00:15,408 --> 00:00:18,758
and I'm going to call it hist to make
histogram of the plot.

6
00:00:18,758 --> 00:00:23,551
So, the first thing you'll, you'll notice
when I called hist, is that a plot window

7
00:00:23,551 --> 00:00:27,021
opens up.
So, let me just move it over here, and the

8
00:00:27,021 --> 00:00:31,071
histogram of the data is shown.
And you can see that, even though I didn't

9
00:00:31,071 --> 00:00:36,057
actually specify any arguments to hist
besides the data themselves a number of

10
00:00:36,057 --> 00:00:40,027
things appeared on the plot ag, without my
specifying them.

11
00:00:40,027 --> 00:00:45,020
So, for example, there's a title here and
then there's an x label here, so here the,

12
00:00:45,037 --> 00:00:50,013
the label is just x because that's what
the object was called when I passed it to

13
00:00:50,013 --> 00:00:53,018
hist.
The label here is frequency which is the

14
00:00:53,018 --> 00:00:58,017
default for histogram so it shows you the
number of elements within this range.

15
00:00:58,017 --> 00:01:02,567
So, for example, between minus one and
zero there's going to, there's a little

16
00:01:02,567 --> 00:01:06,877
over 30 elements of the vector in that
range and you can see that the shape of

17
00:01:06,877 --> 00:01:10,067
the histogram is roughly like a normal
distribution.

18
00:01:10,253 --> 00:01:15,094
So, let me just generate some more data
here and so, we can make a little scatter

19
00:01:15,094 --> 00:01:17,667
plot.
So, I'm going to generate some more data

20
00:01:17,838 --> 00:01:21,347
and I'll plot xy here.
So now, the plotting window is already

21
00:01:21,347 --> 00:01:26,003
open, so when I call plot it's not going
to launch a new plotting window, it's

22
00:01:26,003 --> 00:01:30,680
going to send the plot to the, the current
plotting window, which is this one here.

23
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:36,486
So, I've specified, I've called plot and
you can see the mixed scatter plot of the

24
00:01:36,486 --> 00:01:41,554
points the default plotting symbol here is
an open circle you can see and again the

25
00:01:41,554 --> 00:01:46,209
labeling, I didn't specify any arguments
besides x and y, but the number of things

26
00:01:46,209 --> 00:01:50,934
have occurred in the plot, for example,
the label here as specified as x on the

27
00:01:50,934 --> 00:01:53,979
x-axis and the label on the y-axis is
specified as y.

28
00:01:53,979 --> 00:01:59,091
If I had changed the name of the object,
so let's say, I say rnorm 100 here and I

29
00:01:59,091 --> 00:02:02,351
plot x and z.
Well, the plot looks different because the

30
00:02:02,351 --> 00:02:07,839
data are different but you can see the
label here turn, turn to z, because that's

31
00:02:07,839 --> 00:02:12,081
the name of the object.
So, let me just go back to x and y.

32
00:02:13,287 --> 00:02:19,054
And so, a number of things on the plotting
region are important for example, the

33
00:02:19,054 --> 00:02:24,043
margins here are, are these are four
margins here, one for each side.

34
00:02:24,286 --> 00:02:30,617
This is side one, this is side two this is
side three and this is side four over

35
00:02:30,617 --> 00:02:34,401
here.
You can see the margin for the bottom is,

36
00:02:34,631 --> 00:02:38,202
is, is the largest.
So, there's, there's five lines of margin

37
00:02:38,202 --> 00:02:41,604
text available.
On the side two, there's four lines of

38
00:02:41,604 --> 00:02:46,000
margin text available.
On the top, there's also four, so side

39
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,914
three, and on the right side, side four,
there's the smallest amount of a margin

40
00:02:51,914 --> 00:02:55,456
text available.
So, you can adjust that using the mar

41
00:02:55,456 --> 00:02:58,593
function.
So, for example, I can just say par, and

42
00:02:58,593 --> 00:03:04,030
then I say mar equals, let's say, I want,
let's say, I want two on every side.

43
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:06,032
So, two, two, two, two.
Excuse me.

44
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:11,610
And then I can plot again and you can see
that now the plot the margins have gotten

45
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:16,072
a lot smaller and the plot kind of extends
farther out into the window.

46
00:03:16,072 --> 00:03:21,050
But the problem, as you can see that on
the x and the y-axis, I lost my label.

47
00:03:21,249 --> 00:03:26,073
And so, even though I have the tick marks
there I don't have my x and y label.

48
00:03:26,073 --> 00:03:30,044
So, we probably need to make them a little
bigger than that.

49
00:03:30,044 --> 00:03:32,447
So, maybe I'll say four, four, two, two,
like that.

50
00:03:32,447 --> 00:03:37,712
So now, if I plot again now you can see
there is just enough for the x and y label

51
00:03:37,712 --> 00:03:40,384
there.
I'm just going to demo a couple of the

52
00:03:40,384 --> 00:03:44,797
other options that may be of interest to
you as you're quick constructing your

53
00:03:44,797 --> 00:03:46,983
plot.
So, the first is the plotting symbol.

54
00:03:46,983 --> 00:03:49,983
I can say plot xy and then pch equals,
let's say, twenty.

55
00:03:50,149 --> 00:03:54,794
That gives me a solid circle here.
If I want a slightly solid symbol here I

56
00:03:54,794 --> 00:03:57,782
could say pch = nineteen.
Or I could, you know, specify pch = two

57
00:03:57,783 --> 00:04:01,875
and that gives me triangles, three gives
me little plus signs, four gives me xs,

58
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:04,319
etc.
As you can see, so, you can see that

59
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,072
there's many different plotting symbols to
try.

60
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:11,019
You might be wondering how I know all the
numbers for these plotting symbols.

61
00:04:11,019 --> 00:04:15,919
Well, that just comes after many years of
use, I've memorized most of them all but

62
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:21,143
of course, if you haven't memorized them
quite yet a handy tool is the example file

63
00:04:21,143 --> 00:04:24,044
for points.
So, if you just hit points, example set of

64
00:04:24,044 --> 00:04:29,171
points it'll go through a number of demos
so you can see how the capabilities that R

65
00:04:29,347 --> 00:04:33,090
that R can do of plotting.
But most important are the, is there a

66
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:37,034
little plot of, sorry, a little chart of
the symbols here.

67
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:42,049
And so, you can see that's a, for example,
one is a open circle, two is the triangle,

68
00:04:42,049 --> 00:04:46,374
three is the plus, etc.
Here twenty was the solid circle, small,

69
00:04:46,374 --> 00:04:50,076
nineteen, was the larger circle.
If you wanted a solid square, that's

70
00:04:50,076 --> 00:04:53,076
fifteen a solid triangle of seventeen,
etc.

71
00:04:53,076 --> 00:04:59,005
So, you can specify what type of symbol
you want just by using the number here.

72
00:04:59,204 --> 00:05:03,947
Another, the thing, if you notice the
symbols 21 through 25 those are actually

73
00:05:03,947 --> 00:05:08,926
symbols that are similar to say, to ones
that are, that have been previously shown,

74
00:05:08,926 --> 00:05:13,559
so for example, one through six.
However, the difference is in 21 through

75
00:05:13,559 --> 00:05:18,950
25, those symbols have a have a boundary
so you can see that the boundary is red.

76
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:22,835
And they have a fill which in this case is
yellow.

77
00:05:22,835 --> 00:05:28,638
So, you can specify two different colors,
one for the boundary and for the outline,

78
00:05:28,638 --> 00:05:32,961
and one for the color.
And so, the boundary color is specified

79
00:05:32,961 --> 00:05:37,752
using the col, col argument.
And the, the background color, the fill

80
00:05:37,752 --> 00:05:41,578
color is specified by using the bg
argument.

81
00:05:41,578 --> 00:05:44,072
So.
You, so, you can specify two different

82
00:05:44,072 --> 00:05:50,051
colors like that if you want.
Here's another chart of the plotting

83
00:05:50,051 --> 00:05:56,907
symbols and you can continue through the
demo here for points if you want and let

84
00:05:56,907 --> 00:06:02,076
me just finish it up here.
It's just some of the special symbols that

85
00:06:02,076 --> 00:06:06,092
you can plot if you want.
This is in a different font.

86
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:14,364
And let me just quit out of here.
So, so, that's one way to change the

87
00:06:14,364 --> 00:06:20,010
symbol here.
I'm going to go back to my plot here, so

88
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:26,479
pch equals let's say, twenty.
Excuse me I have to regenerate my data

89
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:34,729
because it was overwritten by the example.
So, here is my data again my little

90
00:06:34,729 --> 00:06:39,940
scatter plot.
Now, I can add a title to the plot by

91
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:47,078
using the title and I will say this is my
scatter plot and that adds the title.

92
00:06:48,198 --> 00:06:53,031
I could add some text if I wanted to.
So, for example, I could use the text

93
00:06:53,031 --> 00:06:58,658
function to say, add a little label here.
Let's say, I will give it the coordinates,

94
00:06:58,658 --> 00:07:04,075
let's say -two and -two.
See that label appears there, I can add a

95
00:07:04,075 --> 00:07:10,049
legend if I wanted to.
Save the legend, and the legend you can

96
00:07:10,049 --> 00:07:17,068
give it kind of location specifications,
for example, top left will put the legend

97
00:07:17,068 --> 00:07:23,075
in the top left, and then I'll say just
give it a specific label.

98
00:07:23,297 --> 00:07:29,010
Excuse me, let me just put [unknown].
So now, I've got a little legend there.

99
00:07:29,225 --> 00:07:35,052
And so there's all kinds of annotations
that you can add to the data as you kind

100
00:07:35,052 --> 00:07:39,024
of go along.
So, for example, I could fiddle, if I want

101
00:07:39,024 --> 00:07:44,080
to plot a line in the data, I can fit a
linear model using the lm function and

102
00:07:45,002 --> 00:07:49,687
then the ab line function will add the
linear model fit on top of that here.

103
00:07:49,687 --> 00:07:55,382
The data are related to the other, each
other so, that the linear model is, the

104
00:07:55,382 --> 00:07:59,055
line is pretty flat.
If I wanted to adjust the thick, the

105
00:07:59,055 --> 00:08:04,803
thickness of that line, I could use the ab
line and specify the lwd to be, let's say,

106
00:08:04,803 --> 00:08:07,084
three.
You can see that a new line is plotted

107
00:08:07,084 --> 00:08:11,089
over there, which is much thicker.
So, you probably wouldn't want to do this

108
00:08:11,089 --> 00:08:16,010
or from the get-go, if you want to remake
this plot, you'd probably just specify

109
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:20,025
from the get-go lwd = three.
You don't want to just like plot two lines

110
00:08:20,025 --> 00:08:24,062
on top of each other, but I'm just showing
this for demonstrate, demonstration sake.

111
00:08:24,218 --> 00:08:29,093
I could have also changed the color.
So I make the color, say, blue and that

112
00:08:29,093 --> 00:08:33,327
would make it blue.
And so there are lots of different types

113
00:08:33,327 --> 00:08:38,072
of options you can specify here when
you're, as you're making a plot.

114
00:08:38,264 --> 00:08:43,461
So, usually, you're going to, want to
create x labels and y labels which are,

115
00:08:43,461 --> 00:08:48,843
kind of represent what the data are.
So, you can plot, you can put a lot of

116
00:08:48,843 --> 00:08:54,132
these options in the plot function itself.
So, I could say, plot xy and maybe, and

117
00:08:54,132 --> 00:09:00,664
maybe x lab is let's see, weight, and then
a y lay up a y lab will be, say, height.

118
00:09:01,299 --> 00:09:06,023
Main will be scatter plot.
Pch will be twenty.

119
00:09:06,023 --> 00:09:11,305
So, that gets, now I have actual labels on
the x-axis and y-axis.

120
00:09:11,522 --> 00:09:17,213
I can put my legend back, if I want.
You know, I'll put it in the top right

121
00:09:17,213 --> 00:09:27,698
this time.
And then I can add my little line here.

122
00:09:27,698 --> 00:09:36,110
So, let's say, fit is, or maybe I'll make
the line red this time.

123
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:44,419
So, that's my plot with the labels with
the linear aggression line and with the

124
00:09:44,419 --> 00:09:47,760
legend.
Now, lets see what happens when we try to

125
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:52,166
put more than one plot on the page.
So, for example, let's say, I have an

126
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:57,330
another variable which I'll call z.
And may be it's I don't know, let me make

127
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,652
some plus on data here.
Oh, excuse me.

128
00:09:59,798 --> 00:10:04,660
And let's say, I want to plot z versus x
and then I also want to plot y versus x on

129
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:08,609
the same canvas here.
So the first thing I can do is, let's say,

130
00:10:08,609 --> 00:10:13,029
I want to put, let's say, I want to put
the plots right on top of each other.

131
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:18,324
So, I'll say par mf row equals so, what is
going to happen is I want to have two rows

132
00:10:18,324 --> 00:10:21,323
of plots and then one column of plots,
right?

133
00:10:21,323 --> 00:10:26,670
So, that's what we want to see.
So now, let's plot x and y on top and x

134
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:30,958
and z on the bottom.
So, x and y, pch goes twenty, so you see

135
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:36,042
that goes on that top.
And on the bottom here, all you have x and

136
00:10:36,042 --> 00:10:39,659
z, say, equals nineteen and that goes on
the bottom.

137
00:10:39,659 --> 00:10:45,366
So now, you can see that the margins are
little bit large here, probably larger

138
00:10:45,366 --> 00:10:50,015
than we would want.
And you see that the, the margin that I,

139
00:10:50,015 --> 00:10:54,411
that's specified here is that.
And so, we probably want to adjust the

140
00:10:54,411 --> 00:11:01,004
size of the margin, now that we've kind of
rearranged the configuration of the plots.

141
00:11:01,409 --> 00:11:10,063
So, we can maybe say something like par,
same r equals that.

142
00:11:11,038 --> 00:11:16,677
Now, if I plot it again, they get a little
bit bigger.

143
00:11:16,677 --> 00:11:24,515
Say, twenty again.
So that's how, now I put two plots on the

144
00:11:24,515 --> 00:11:27,674
screen.
I could have done it the other way.

145
00:11:27,674 --> 00:11:33,950
I could have said, instead of having them
top and bottom, I could have had them

146
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:38,632
right and left, by saying par mf row
equals, say, one, two.

147
00:11:38,847 --> 00:11:47,039
Now I can plot like this like that.
So, I can see I made the margins a little

148
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:51,076
bit too small cuz I lost my y-axis label
here.

149
00:11:51,076 --> 00:11:56,937
So, I'm able to say par, I'll go back to
four, four, two, two like this and make

150
00:11:56,937 --> 00:12:02,608
the plots again.
So, you can see that when you rearrange

151
00:12:02,608 --> 00:12:07,529
the plotting layout, you might want to
rearrange the, the, the canvas itself to

152
00:12:07,529 --> 00:12:12,086
kind of remove some of the white space.
I won't do that for the moment just so I

153
00:12:12,086 --> 00:12:16,902
can continue with the demo here.
But, for example, you can put four plots

154
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:22,715
on a page like, say, mar equals, sorry, I
meant mf row equals two, two, that means

155
00:12:22,715 --> 00:12:26,694
two rows and two columns.
So, I can say plot x and y, now go in the

156
00:12:26,694 --> 00:12:29,063
upper left.
You see that, now if we plot x and z, you

157
00:12:29,063 --> 00:12:31,084
might wonder where is the next plot going
to go?

158
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:35,063
Well, because I specified mf row, the
plots are going to go across the rows.

159
00:12:35,063 --> 00:12:38,561
So, the next plot is going to be in the
upper right and then the next plot is

160
00:12:38,561 --> 00:12:43,039
going to be in the lower left so let me
say, a plot of z and x instead of x and z.

161
00:12:43,239 --> 00:12:47,097
And then, the last plot is going to go in
the lower right here.

162
00:12:47,097 --> 00:12:52,834
So, that, now, I've got four plots on a
page by specifying, specifying the mf row

163
00:12:53,077 --> 00:12:57,034
option.
If I've specified mf col the same thing

164
00:12:57,034 --> 00:13:02,085
would've happened, but the order in which
the plots occurred would've been

165
00:13:02,085 --> 00:13:06,560
different.
So now, I can say, plot xy and that

166
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:11,481
appears on the same place but the next
plot now is going to appear on the lower

167
00:13:11,481 --> 00:13:14,601
left.
And the next plot is going to be in the

168
00:13:14,601 --> 00:13:18,027
upper right and the last plot is going to
be in the lower right.

169
00:13:18,027 --> 00:13:21,008
So, that's the difference between mf row
and mf col.

170
00:13:21,096 --> 00:13:27,008
The last option I'll talk about here is
the points function, just as a, just a

171
00:13:27,008 --> 00:13:31,087
demonstration to how you can annotate a
plot by adding things to it.

172
00:13:31,087 --> 00:13:37,047
So let me just reset the plot regions so
that I'm only doing one plot at a time

173
00:13:37,047 --> 00:13:40,051
here.
Now suppose I generate some data and

174
00:13:40,051 --> 00:13:45,519
suppose that the data consists of, say,
men and women, so there's two groups of

175
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:49,041
people here.
So I'm just going to generate some data

176
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:54,067
here, and maybe I'll give them a little
relationship so it's a little bit more

177
00:13:54,067 --> 00:13:58,069
interesting.
And let's say I've got another variable

178
00:13:58,069 --> 00:14:02,047
here which is the group and its going to
be half and half.

179
00:14:02,047 --> 00:14:06,052
So, there's two groups and the 50 level,
50 iteration speech.

180
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:09,086
Let me just give them names, let's say
labels.

181
00:14:13,011 --> 00:14:16,078
So, you got males and females in this
group of people here.

182
00:14:16,078 --> 00:14:19,055
You can see that it's a factor variable of
two levels.

183
00:14:19,055 --> 00:14:24,050
So, suppose I want to plot the data, if I
just plot the data x and y you can not

184
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:28,096
tell who are the males and who are
females, right, because, they all are the

185
00:14:28,096 --> 00:14:31,833
same color, for example.
And so, suppose I want to plot the data

186
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:35,077
and plot and make males one color and
females another color.

187
00:14:35,265 --> 00:14:39,026
So, how do I do that?
So, first thing you want to do, the basic

188
00:14:39,026 --> 00:14:43,606
idea is you're going to set up the plot
region, but you are not going to plot any

189
00:14:43,606 --> 00:14:46,682
of the data.
And then you're going to add the data by

190
00:14:46,682 --> 00:14:50,060
gender, so you can maybe add the females
first, and then add the males.

191
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:54,040
And the idea is that each time you add the
data points, there will be other different

192
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:57,012
colors, or perhaps a different plotting
symbol or whatever.

193
00:14:57,012 --> 00:14:59,030
So, let, first, let's set up the plotting
region.

194
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:02,085
So, I'm going to say, plot xy.
So, I'm going to pass at the data but I'm

195
00:15:02,085 --> 00:15:06,017
going to, say, type equals n.
So this means, make the plot but don't

196
00:15:06,017 --> 00:15:10,002
actually put the data in there.
So, you can see when I hii, when I execute

197
00:15:10,002 --> 00:15:12,082
this function, everything happens just
like before.

198
00:15:12,082 --> 00:15:17,043
The labels are put in, the, the tick marks
are put in the margins are specified,

199
00:15:17,043 --> 00:15:21,098
everything is there, except for the data.
So, the only thing that's missing is the

200
00:15:21,098 --> 00:15:23,532
data.
And so, what I'm going to do is I'm going

201
00:15:23,532 --> 00:15:28,708
to add the data, add one group at a time.
So, let's say, I add the males first,

202
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:33,005
like, say, point x.
Then, I'm going to subset the vectors that

203
00:15:33,005 --> 00:15:36,512
the g, I only take the points, where g is
equal to male, right?

204
00:15:36,512 --> 00:15:40,586
So, that's a subset.
And then, I'm going to say y, and g is

205
00:15:40,586 --> 00:15:43,815
equal to male.
So, this is only going to plot the, plot

206
00:15:43,815 --> 00:15:48,039
the points where, where the values of g
variable equal to males.

207
00:15:48,039 --> 00:15:53,440
I'm going to set, make that color green,
okay?

208
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:58,200
So now, you can see the points on the, on
the screen are green.

209
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:01,420
Those are, those represent the male points
only.

210
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:04,705
So I can do the same thing for the
females.

211
00:16:04,705 --> 00:16:10,033
I can say, points x and then g is equal to
female and the yg is equal to female.

212
00:16:10,033 --> 00:16:16,087
And let's say, I'll make these blue.
So now, you can see that there are blue

213
00:16:16,087 --> 00:16:19,643
circles for the females and there's green
circles for the males.

214
00:16:19,643 --> 00:16:23,833
And so, you can see the two groups
separately within the scatter plot.

215
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:28,661
And so, sub setting based on a grouping
variable is very common when a making

216
00:16:28,661 --> 00:16:30,845
plots.
And the points function can used to kind

217
00:16:30,845 --> 00:16:34,507
of add points sequentially by group so
that it can specify different types

218
00:16:34,507 --> 00:16:38,347
properties for each group.
You can also, in, in addition to varying

219
00:16:38,347 --> 00:16:41,517
the color, I could have changed the
plotting symbol, so I could have said pch

220
00:16:41,517 --> 00:16:45,011
equal to, I'll say, nineteen.
So, this is a kind of solid circle here,

221
00:16:45,011 --> 00:16:48,084
and that would have given me a solid blue
circle for the females, and an open green

222
00:16:48,084 --> 00:16:52,057
circle for the males.
So, that's one way to, to separate up

223
00:16:52,057 --> 00:16:55,077
groups of data points on a single scatter
plot.
